# A collection of game physics demos created for JSOxford

There are four demos:
- [app1](http://peterjwest.github.io/game_physics/app1.html) is a demo of basic newtonian motion, click on the screen to make stuff happen
- [app2](http://peterjwest.github.io/game_physics/app2.html) is a demo of simple collision handling, detects intersections between the motion of each ball and each wall
- [app3](http://peterjwest.github.io/game_physics/app3.html) is the same as app3, but applying a rotation to a few of the walls and to gravity itself
- [app4](http://peterjwest.github.io/game_physics/app4.html) is a 2D implementation of, [GJK](http://physics2d.com/content/gjk-algorithm) a powerful collision detection algorithm
