# A collection of game physics demos created for JSOxford

There are four demos, you can try out each one by changing the script tag in the html file (sorry, it's low tech!):
- `app1.js` is a demo of basic newtonian motion, click on the screen to make stuff happen
- `app2.js` is a demo of simple collision handling, detects intersections between the motion of each ball and each wall
- `app3.js` is the same as app3, but applying a rotation to a few of the walls and to gravity itself
- `app4.js` is a 2D implementation of, [GJK](http://physics2d.com/content/gjk-algorithm) a powerful collision detection algorithm
