# A collection of game physics demos created for JSOxford

There are four demos, you can try out each one by changing the script tag in the html file (sorry, its low tech!):
- `app1.js` is a demo of basic newtonian motion, click on the screen to make stuff happen
- `app2.js` is a demo of simple collision handling, detect an intersection between the motion of each ball and each wall
- `app3.js` is the same as 3, but applying a rotation to the gravity vector and a couple of walls
- `app4.js` is a 2D implementation of, [GJK](http://physics2d.com/content/gjk-algorithm) a powerful collision detection algorithm
